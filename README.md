post2image takes in a URL for a social media post and returns a card that points to an image of the post. 

## Purpose 
The main goal is to make it easy to repost or quote post a Xitter post (but also threads and possibly 
others) onto Bluesky and have it look like a the full original post. This would be simpler than having 
to take a screenshot of the original post and then post it. 

And importantly, currently Xitter doesn't provide any reasonable image of the post if one just uses the 
original URL on Bluesky. Yes, something else broken by Space Karen.
