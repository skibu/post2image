    <p lang="en">As part of applying for SSD disability for having #LongCovid, I had a mandatory in-person 2 hour
        mental assessment. Got to the door &amp; first test was intercom (10 min). And then the looong staircase.
        WTF?? Totally inaccessible office. Took multiple rest stops. And then the interviewer wasnâ€™t masking!
